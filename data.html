      <p>The concept for my independent work project is based on W.E.B Duboisâ€™ 1890s 
        series of infographics depicting different representations of inequality at 
        the time. Some of his images incorporated spirals to show the vast disparities 
        (Chalabi). I was inspired by his use of the spiral because it represented a new 
        and innovative method of visualization at the time. </p>

      <p>The goal of my independent work project is to construct new methods of data 
        visualization which I will use to investigate the nuance and inequality 
        surrounding racial representation and experience on social media. I wanted 
        to produce spiraling animations to map differences in social media representation 
        by racial group. Through this project I would developed my own programs for 
        combining different forms of data into a visual presentation. Taking statistics 
        about top TikTok users I created independent shapes for each racial category, 
        displaying differences in the data through aspects such as edge shape, color, 
        and of course movement. The program is able to be applied to data on diverse 
        subjects outside of social media representation. </p>
